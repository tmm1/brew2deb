Subject: [PATCH] upload-pack: add a trigger for post-upload-pack hook

A post-upload-pack hook is desirable for Git hosts that need to
collect statistics on how many clones and/or fetches are made
on each repository.

The hook is called with either "clone" or "fetch" as the only
argument, depending on whether a full pack file was sent to the
client or not.
